This is an app that selects random real world teams in different leagues and provides varying odds. Generation of odds has no affiliation to the abilities of said teams in the real world.
This is simply for fun and is not to be used for any gambling practices.

How the code works:
Player can select what league they want to play, and are also allowed to deposit funds within the limitations provided. Fixtures are randomly generated and odds are provided alongside. Player then selects winner(s) as a straight bet or a parlay.
Winners are also chosen at random and not based on odds. In this respect, the game is more similar to a slot machine for example than a gambling app.
If player wins, all winnings are added to the balance from the initial deposit.
